figure_footnotes:
 logistic_plot: The independent variable was divided into quartiles. The summary statistics for each quartile are reported in the footnote as median (minimum, maximum). Black points and error bars represent the observed proportions and 95% CIs for each quartile (plotted at the median exposure within each quartile), respectively. The blue curve represents the prediction of the univariate logistic regression model, and the blue shaded region represents the 95% CI of the prediction. The displayed p-value is for the logistic regression slope.
 boxplot: Boxplots show the distribution of the exposure parameter. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles). The horizontal line inside each box represents the median. The whiskers extend from the hinge to ±1.5 x inter-quartile range (IQR). The circles represent each individual exposure parameter.
 TTE_plot: The summary statistics for each quartile are reported in the legend as median (minimum, maximum).
 correlation_plot: R is the coefficient of correlation and p is the p-value for the correlation coefficient
 GOF_plot: Dots are individual data points, and solid red lines are LOESS lines. In the 2 plots in the top row, solid black lines are lines of identity, while in the right bottom corner plot, solid black line are at y=0.
 ETA_histogram: The histograms show the post hoc ETAs for each parameter. Dashed red vertical lines are medians. Solid black lines are at x=0; dashed black lines are the density curves.
 VPC: The black dots are observed data points, the black solid line is the observed median, and the black dashed lines are the observed p5 and p95. The blue solid line is the predicted median, and the red solid lines are the predicted p5 and p95. The blue area is the 95% CI of the simulated median, and the red areas are the 95% CI of the simulated p5 and p95
 kaplan-meier-plot: This Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrates the probability of survival over time for patients in the study. The x-axis represents time in months, while the y-axis shows the estimated survival probability. Each step down on the curve indicates an event (e.g., death, relapse) among the cohort. Censored observations, where patients were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study before an event occurred, are marked with vertical ticks on the curve. The shaded area around the curve represents the 95% confidence interval, providing an estimate of the uncertainty around the survival probability at each time point. Differences between groups (e.g., treatment vs. control) are compared using the log-rank test, with a p-value < 0.05 indicating statistical significance
 conc-time-trajectories: This plot shows individual concentration-time trajectories for subjects in the study. The x-axis represents time (hours) and the y-axis shows drug concentration (ng/mL). Each line corresponds to a subject's concentration profile, illustrating variability in pharmacokinetics across the population. Key points like peak concentration (Cmax) and time to peak (Tmax) can be identified visually. No aggregation or smoothing has been applied, preserving the raw individual data
 linear-regression-plot: The plot shows a linear regression model, where the dots represent the observed data points and the line represents the fitted linear regression line
 probit-regression-plot: The plot shows a probit regression model, where the dots represent the observed data points and the line represents the fitted probit regression curve

 ER_summary: 'For the univariate analyses, the top 3 covariates resulting in ΔOFV >6.63 relative to the null model were included. Additionally, any covariates resulting in a ΔOFV > 10.83 were included. Only the strongest exposure covariate was included; if LNCTAUA was not the strongest exposure covariate, it was also included for reference. For the final model hazard and odds ratios, the following values of Delta were used for the continuous covariates: LNCTAUA: 0.3, SBCMABLN: 0.4'
